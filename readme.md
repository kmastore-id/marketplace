# Ansible Lint for GitHub Action
This action allows you to run `ansible-lint` with no additional options.


## Usage
To use the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/main.workflow`.

```hcl
action "Lint Ansible Playbook" {
  uses = "ansible/ansible-lint-action@master"
}
```

N.B. Use `v4.1.0` or any other valid tag, or branch, or commit SHA instead
of `master` to pin the action to use a specific version.


### Environment Variables
- **ACTION_PLAYBOOK_NAME**: (optional) defaults to `playbook.yml`
